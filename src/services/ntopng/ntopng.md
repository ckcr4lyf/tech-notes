# ntopng

[ntopng](https://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-analysis/ntop/) is a pretty cool tool to view network traffic in real time.

It also performs DPI to extract some metadata about connections you can observe, such as SNI (for TLS), or the infohash (for BitTorrent).

It is especially interesting when run on a firewall / router of sorts.
